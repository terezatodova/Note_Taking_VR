# Note_Taking_VR
Bachelor's thesis code and demo videos
In my bachelor's thesis I worked with an existing VR application - EDive which connects students and teachers in virtual reality in order to conduct classes. I created three different note-taking methods/tools that are curently used in EDive, namely a 3D pen, Sticky Notes and Voice Recordings. These notes are synced over the network, which also enables another form of communication.
